gst-httpd
=========

A simple HTTP server for interacting with GStreamer based pipelines

This project was created to explore using GStreamer as a source of media
for an M-JPEG over HTTP server using multipart/x-mixed-replace.  It is
heavily based on (and borrows much code structure from) the excellent
gst-rtsp-server project at:
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-rtsp-server/
